      <description>A few months ago I asked a question on Twitter &amp;ldquo;If you have a well thought out design, clean code, wonderful testing and painless deployment but the feature ends up never being used because the user didn‚Äôt want or need it in the first place, is that a quality feature?&amp;rdquo;
I got some very interesting responses.
We are very focused on how we deliver quality but maybe we need to spend more time looking at what we deliver.</description>

      <description>Serverless technology is relatively new and arguably began with the advent of AWS Lambda in 2015. Since then, serverless has become a hot buzzword which has been as greatly misunderstood as DevOps or container technology. This talk aims to demystify serverless concepts and illustrate the many benefits of embracing it. We will talk about common scenarios where serverless is beneficial and where it is not.
We will see a real-world demonstration application built on AWS technology (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, S3, CloudFormation and more) using .</description>

      <description>Continuous Delivery helps to keep your software and Docker images updated and deploy new versions in production easily. Microservices are great reducing the attack vector and limiting the privileges or credentials access of each piece of your application. Containers provide an opportunity to implement better security, small, inmutable, single process and purpose. How can we implement a DevSecOps process?
In this session, we will discover real use case examples on how to make your CI/CD pipeline interact with Docker security tools and deploy Kubernetes security features.</description>

      <description>Software Testing is one of the most misunderstood things within the software industry. Too many people have misconceptions about the craft, but that‚Äôs probably because it&amp;rsquo;s hard to define and describe.
Lots of people look to models for answers, but because all models are fallible, they&amp;rsquo;ve added to the problem&amp;hellip; Take the automation pyramid as an example - Many people have formed testing strategies around the automation pyramid based on the flawed thinking that you can automate all the testing things.</description>

      <description>Breakfast is the meal where you prepare yourself for the day ‚Äì for doing something great. In DevOps continuous improvement is an important goal for the individual, the team, the system and the organization. But what if the organizational culture is the way that improvement will be eaten before you can prepare for it?
This non-technical talk will tell the story of an ambitious project in difficulties and the half-hearted attempts to improve or even rescue it.</description>

      <guid>/talks/2019/paul-mcgrath-why-web-performance-is-critical-for-product-success/</guid>
      <description>Web performance can make or break your product. Users now expect features to be fast, yet are constantly waiting for apps to download, bootstrap, or finish rendering.
Under-prioritising web performance, then, sets us up for early failure, unless we consider it as a guiding principle that we fold into both our design and development work-streams.
At Dell EMC, the Live Optics group have been building data analysis services since 2009. Recently we began to build the future foundations of our growing platform, led by this insight.</description>

      <description>When developing scalable and responsive applications it is essential to leverage the parallelism provided by the underlying platform. Modern server hardware can support dozens, hundreds or even thousands of cores, but coding directly against these is beyond the reach of the vast majority of developers.
In modern JVM languages like Kotlin three approaches are available for simplifying the addition of parallelism. The first is the concept of Coroutines, which became an official and integral part of the Kotlin language in version 1.</description>

      <description>At the Financial Times, we built our first microservices in 2013. We like a microservices-based approach, because by breaking up the system into lots of independently deployable services - making releases small, quick and reversible - we can deliver more value, more quickly, to our customers and we can run hundreds of experiments a year.
However, to benefit from this new approach we had to make some pretty big changes to our culture.</description>

      <description>The volume of medical data being collected is continuously increasing as technology improves while the time and expertise required to analyse it is consistently scarce. Globally there is a critical shortage of radiologists to analyse scans and neurophysiologists to analyse EEG (brain-waves). At the INFANT research centre in University College Cork we are using artificial intelligence to develop tools which can analyse medical signals and scans to identify and quantify anomalies.</description>

      <guid>/talks/2018/mandi-walls-building-security-into-your-worflow/</guid>
      <description>InSpec is an open source testing framework for infrastructure with a human- and machine-readable language for specifying compliance, security, and policy requirements. Using a combination of command-line and remote-execution tools, InSpec can help you keep your infrastructure aligned with security and compliance guidelines on an ongoing basis, rather than waiting for and then remediating from arduous annual audits.
InSpec‚Äôs flexibility makes it a key tool choice for incorporating security into a complete continuous delivery workflow, reducing the risk of new features and releases breaking established host-based security guidelines.</description>

      <guid>/talks/2018/david-gonzalez-continuous-delivery-devsecops-kubernetes/</guid>
      <description>Nowadays, Continuous Delivery is a must. Nobody starts a new application without asking: how can we make deployments as painless as possible? The only answer to it is Kubernetes. Full stop. Kubernetes is the solution to 99% of the problems on a software development/deployment pipeline because it was engineered for it.
The problem with CD pipelines is the security: there are no standards for securing a CD pipeline as it is something new and security takes time to catch up with the requirements.</description>

      <description>Product Management and UX ought to have shared goals, right? Both disciplines essentially seek to build software to help customers drive business outcomes. The reality is, however, that alignment between both roles is not always complete, especially in the white heat of agile development. This can happen for various reasons and this talk will identify the major problems that can cause misalignment and strategies for dealing with them as they arise or to help avoid them entirely.</description>

      <guid>/talks/2018/rob-meaney-from-tester-to-test-coach/</guid>
      <description>I believe that the evolving role of a tester is to advocate for and encourage the right testing to be done rather than performing the testing activity.
As a result of this belief I have embarked on a journey, from being a dedicated tester on a scrum team to a test coach advocating for quality and influencing test practices across an entire organisation.
In this session i&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the emotions, obstacles, successes and learning that I experienced during my journey so far.</description>

      <description>Empathy is a fundamental part of human interaction. When we communicate by email or at conferences, or indirectly, when we create products, events, or do a talk. However, our understanding of other people is full of error, and worse, bias. This can lead us to make communities and products that work poorly for people that are different from ourselves, introduce confusion and misunderstanding, exclude people unintentionally, and sometimes even cause harm.</description>

      <description>In recent years, microservice architecture has become an extremely popular way of delivering server side features. Microservices provide the ability to deploy isolated changes reducing the fear of undesirable side effects or bugs. Another benefit to this that they allow new teams to confidently make changes to code they fully understand. This has been observed numerous times in Poppulo where we‚Äôve had many new starts deploy code to production within hours of starting.</description>

      <description>Are you building what your customers want, or are you just building?
Many companies confuse being busy with producing value, falling into a dangerous place called &amp;ldquo;The Build Trap&amp;rdquo;. They focus more on the motions of shipping feature after feature, without stopping to validate it‚Äôs what customer truly want and need. This is due in part to poor understanding of Product Management.
In order to get get out of the Build Trap and become a successful product-led organization, companies need to use strategy, process, principles, and practices to create an environment that focuses on outcomes for the user and the business rather than outputs.</description>

      <description>TypeScript is Microsoft‚Äôs answer to working large, complex JavaScript code-bases, bringing static typing and EcmaScript 6 features to current browsers. In this talk, you‚Äôll learn how TypeScript was designed to extend and embrace JavaScript idioms and how it will help you out to ensure correct code and behavior.
We will also cover how to use advanced static types in practice by explaining how the compiler analyzes control flow to determine the most specific type for a variable at any given location.</description>

      <description>When talking about testing, hearing the word automation usually means automated tests, to some they are synonyms. But not to Richard Bradshaw. In his eyes Automation is integral to delivering software and even more so in delivering quality software. During this workshop, we‚Äôre going to discuss and explore ways we can use Automation to support our testing efforts far beyond automated checks.</description>

      <description>In the agile world we find a lot of slogans around the topic of failure: &amp;ldquo;Welcome failure&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;fail fast&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Fail early&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Fail often&amp;rdquo; are used regularly. And in theory we all agree that we can learn from failure. Some of us are also dreaming of a Blameless Culture.
But then daily business chatches us up&amp;hellip; The search for the guilty person starts as well as the finger pointing procedure! Everyone can breathe a sigh of relief not being identified as the originator of a failure.</description>

      <description>Sam has found himself spending much of the past few years dealing with buzzword-heavy areas of technology, trying to come to terms with what it all means. From DevOps, to Microservices, serverless and now Cloud Native. So many of these terms mean different things to different people. In an effort to try and set us up with a common understanding of what Cloud Native is, Sam will be taking us on a whistle-stop tour through the history leading up to Cloud Native, and try and synthesise what it is, and why it‚Äôs important.</description>
