      <description>InSpec is an open source testing framework for infrastructure with a human- and machine-readable language for specifying compliance, security, and policy requirements. Using a combination of command-line and remote-execution tools, InSpec can help you keep your infrastructure aligned with security and compliance guidelines on an ongoing basis, rather than waiting for and then remediating from arduous annual audits.
InSpec’s flexibility makes it a key tool choice for incorporating security into a complete continuous delivery workflow, reducing the risk of new features and releases breaking established host-based security guidelines.</description>

      <title>Continuous delivery DevSecOps with Kubernetes: stay safe at the speed of light</title>

      <description>Nowadays, Continuous Delivery is a must. Nobody starts a new application without asking: how can we make deployments as painless as possible? The only answer to it is Kubernetes. Full stop. Kubernetes is the solution to 99% of the problems on a software development/deployment pipeline because it was engineered for it.
The problem with CD pipelines is the security: there are no standards for securing a CD pipeline as it is something new and security takes time to catch up with the requirements.</description>

      <description>In recent years, microservice architecture has become an extremely popular way of delivering server side features. Microservices provide the ability to deploy isolated changes reducing the fear of undesirable side effects or bugs. Another benefit to this that they allow new teams to confidently make changes to code they fully understand. This has been observed numerous times in Poppulo where we’ve had many new starts deploy code to production within hours of starting.</description>

      <description>Are you building what your customers want, or are you just building?
Many companies confuse being busy with producing value, falling into a dangerous place called &amp;ldquo;The Build Trap&amp;rdquo;. They focus more on the motions of shipping feature after feature, without stopping to validate it’s what customer truly want and need. This is due in part to poor understanding of Product Management.
In order to get get out of the Build Trap and become a successful product-led organization, companies need to use strategy, process, principles, and practices to create an environment that focuses on outcomes for the user and the business rather than outputs.</description>

      <title>Valuable Automation in Agile Testing</title>

      <description>When talking about testing, hearing the word automation usually means automated tests, to some they are synonyms. But not to Richard Bradshaw. In his eyes Automation is integral to delivering software and even more so in delivering quality software. During this workshop, we’re going to discuss and explore ways we can use Automation to support our testing efforts far beyond automated checks.</description>

      <title>Welcome failure! - Easier said than done!</title>

      <description>In the agile world we find a lot of slogans around the topic of failure: &amp;ldquo;Welcome failure&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;fail fast&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Fail early&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Fail often&amp;rdquo; are used regularly. And in theory we all agree that we can learn from failure. Some of us are also dreaming of a Blameless Culture.
But then daily business chatches us up&amp;hellip; The search for the guilty person starts as well as the finger pointing procedure! Everyone can breathe a sigh of relief not being identified as the originator of a failure.</description>

      <title>What Is This Cloud Native Thing Anyway?</title>

      <description>Sam has found himself spending much of the past few years dealing with buzzword-heavy areas of technology, trying to come to terms with what it all means. From DevOps, to Microservices, serverless and now Cloud Native. So many of these terms mean different things to different people. In an effort to try and set us up with a common understanding of what Cloud Native is, Sam will be taking us on a whistle-stop tour through the history leading up to Cloud Native, and try and synthesise what it is, and why it’s important.</description>
