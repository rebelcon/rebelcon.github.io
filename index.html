It&rsquo;s not feasible to re-architect your real system often, and certainly not in a single day, or is it? This brand new workshop from the author of Building Microservices gives you a safe space to explore ideas behind microservice architectures with peers from other organisations.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we&rsquo;ll share some framing for micro service architectures that explore the various forces that can drive the design and evolution of microservices, and then you&rsquo;ll participate in a series of interactive architectural kata exercises to put your new found knowledge to the test. Afterwards, you&rsquo;ll have a series of tools to take back to your own organisations to put into practice.</p>

                            <p class="workshop-description"><p>Are you building what your customers want, or are you just building?</p>

<p>Many companies confuse being busy with producing value, falling into a dangerous place called &ldquo;The Build Trap&rdquo;. They focus more on the motions of shipping feature after feature, without stopping to validate it’s what customer truly want and need. This is due in part to poor understanding of Product Management.</p>

<p>In order to get get out of the Build Trap and become a successful product-led organization, companies need to use strategy, process, principles, and practices to create an environment that focuses on outcomes for the user and the business rather than outputs.</p>

                            <p class="workshop-description"><p>Sam has found himself spending much of the past few years dealing with buzzword-heavy areas of technology, trying to come to terms with what it all means. From DevOps, to Microservices, serverless and now Cloud Native. So many of these terms mean different things to different people. In an effort to try and set us up with a common understanding of what Cloud Native is, Sam will be taking us on a whistle-stop tour through the history leading up to Cloud Native, and try and synthesise what it is, and why it’s important.</p>

<p>From the emergence of public cloud to the all consuming hype around Kubernetes, from 12 factors to servlerless, Sam will pull all these strands together to help us understand how everything is related, everything is new, and everything is old all at the same time.</p>
