			                Welcome failure! - Easier said than done!
			            </h2>
		            		<p>In the agile world we find a lot of slogans around the topic of failure: &ldquo;Welcome failure&rdquo;, &ldquo;fail fast&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fail early&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fail often&rdquo; are used regularly. And in theory we all agree that we can learn from failure. Some of us are also dreaming of a Blameless Culture.</p>

<p>But then daily business chatches us up&hellip; The search for the guilty person starts as well as the finger pointing procedure! Everyone can breathe a sigh of relief not being identified as the originator of a failure. The idea of having caused a failure is often closely connect with the fear of negative consequences. There are still managers who believe that &ldquo;punishing&rdquo; is the only way to make people learn for the future. And yes, people learn: to hide failure; to avoid work, which is more complex; to not look out of their own box; to follow rules blindly and many more. But in our modern and complex world failure often happen because of a concatenation of previous situations.</p>

<p>If we use the chances of having a close and detailed look on all these events, we will be able to identify weaknesses in our system and processes. And who can give us the best and most qualified insight of what has happened than the originator? The originator is the expert for this failure or failed situation and allows us a change in our perspective: not only the retrospective but also the situation and decisions through the eyes of the originator! But to enable this we need to guarantee a culture of psychological safety and punishment is not the way to do this! This talk will shed a light on the significance of the failure slogans for our daily work and doing as individual, as team and as manager.</p>

<p>The talk will also take a look from the Just Culture perspective on the topic of failure and classify types of failures. The importance knowledge management and resilience engineering we be discussed. The talk will try answer the question what can be done to close the gap between our theoretical understanding of how to deal with failures and the daily doing. It will be a trip through the world of failure which will end up at the topics of culture, mindset, leadership and discipline to make the audience re-think their own behavior.</p>
