<p>Raomal was a recipient of the Irish Software Association’s (ISA) Outstanding Software Achievement Award in 2003. He was also a finalist in the Ernst &amp; Young ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ awards. Raomal was one of 40 entrepreneurs worldwide chosen to the prestigious World Economic Forum (WEF) as a technology pioneer. Headed by Raomal, Valista also won a number of industry accolades, ranging from the Wall Street Journal Innovation GOLD award for business, and the Mobile World Congress Award for the most innovative product.</p>
